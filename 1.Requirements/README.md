## High-Level Requirements (HLRs)

- **Dehazing Capability**:  
  The system must reduce or remove haze from input images and produce visually clear outputs.

- **Machine Learning Model**:  
  The system must use a CNN-based model to perform image dehazing.

- **Dataset Handling**:  
  The system must support both indoor and outdoor hazy datasets for training and testing.

- **Result Evaluation**:  
  The system must evaluate the performance of the dehazing model using quantitative metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM).

- **Platform Compatibility**:  
  The system must be compatible with MATLAB for model training and implementation.

## Low-Level Requirements (LLRs)

- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Input images must be resized to 256x256 pixels for compatibility with the CNN model.  
  - Data augmentation techniques (e.g., flipping, rotation) must be applied to enhance training diversity.

- **Model Architecture**:  
  - The CNN must include specific layers (e.g., convolutional, pooling, ReLU, transposed convolution, etc.).  
  - Layer configurations (e.g., kernel size, stride, padding) must be defined to optimize performance.

- **Custom Datastore**:  
  A custom datastore must be implemented to handle paired input-output datasets (hazy images and ground truth images).

- **Training Pipeline**:  
  - The model must be trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4.  
  - The maximum number of training epochs must be 50, with a mini-batch size of 16.

- **Validation and Testing**:  
  - Validation data must be used to monitor overfitting during training.  
  - Testing must use unseen data to evaluate the model's generalization performance.

## Functional Requirements

- **Input and Output**:  
  Accept hazy images as input and return dehazed images as output.

- **Data Handling**:  
  - Load images from specified directories for training, validation, and testing.  
  - Support paired datasets (hazy and ground truth images).

- **Model Training**:  
  Train the CNN model on the paired datasets and save the trained model for future use.

- **Model Prediction**:  
  Use the trained model to predict dehazed images for new inputs.

- **Performance Metrics**:  
  Compute metrics such as PSNR and SSIM to evaluate model performance.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- **Performance**:  
  The system must process input images and provide dehazed outputs in under 5 seconds per image during inference.

- **Scalability**:  
  The system must handle datasets with at least 1,000 images without significant memory or performance issues.

- **Maintainability**:  
  The codebase must be modular and well-documented for ease of maintenance and future enhancements.

- **Usability**:  
  The system must be user-friendly, allowing researchers or developers to train and test the model with minimal setup.

- **Reliability**:  
  The system must ensure that the dehazed output images are consistent and free from significant artifacts.

- **Energy Efficiency**:  
  The system must minimize computational resource usage during training and inference.
