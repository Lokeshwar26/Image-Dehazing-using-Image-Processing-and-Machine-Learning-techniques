## Extended Project Abstract:  

Image dehazing is vital for computer vision applications like autonomous driving, surveillance, and remote sensing. Haze caused by particles such as dust and moisture degrades visibility, creating challenges for tasks like object detection and tracking. Traditional dehazing methods often fail to address complex haze scenarios and may produce artifacts.  

This project develops a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image dehazing model** leveraging multi-scale feature extraction and attention mechanisms to enhance global and local haze removal capabilities. **Brightness Compensation (BC)** ensures the clarity of dehazed images while preserving color fidelity, crucial for real-time systems like autonomous vehicles.  

The model’s efficiency and effectiveness are validated on synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches. **Quantitative evaluations** using metrics like SSIM, PSNR, and entropy confirm its superiority over existing techniques, while qualitative analyses demonstrate significant improvements in visual clarity.  

Our approach not only improves the visual quality of hazy images but also enhances downstream tasks like object detection, making it indispensable for safety-critical systems such as autonomous driving and surveillance.

## Extended Project Objectives:  

- Develop a lightweight CNN-based dehazing model with multi-scale feature extraction.  
- Incorporate attention mechanisms and brightness compensation to preserve color fidelity.  
- Validate the model’s performance on indoor and outdoor datasets for real-time data applications.  
- Enhance the accuracy of downstream tasks like object detection using dehazed outputs.
